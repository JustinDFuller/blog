In my career I've been fortunate enough to interview for many companies across industries. Almost all of them have been a positive experience, except for a few. Here are the biggest red flags I've encountered in an interview, how to spot them, and how to avoid them when you are the one giving the interview.

## The Interviewer Won't Sell the Role

For the worst interview I've ever been a part of, it wasn't bad because of something the interviewers did; it was bad because of what they didn't do.

Before I begin interviewing with a company, I do some research to see if it aligns with my values and goals, and to see if the work seems interesting. I usually ask something like this: "There are so many great places to work, places that have important missions, meaningful work, and fun cultures. Tell me why you chose to work here, and why I should too."

Almost without fail, the interview will tell me all the things they love about their company. Except once, when they wouldn't.

They responded, "That's really for you to decide. I can't tell you why you should work here."

On the surface this sounds perfectly reasonable. Each of us is unique, with different goals and values, so we must make the choice for ourselves. But this is actually a __huge red flag__. Think about this question in some other context, like when you ask a friend if you should go to the new restaurant that your friend just tried. If they tell you "You have to decide for yourself", are you really going to try it? They clearly had a bad experience but don't want to tell you.

If the interviewer won't sell the role, you can try to reframe the question. You can ask "What's your favorite part about working here?" and "Tell me about a project that you're excited to work on."

If they still can't give you an answer, it's time to realize that they don't enjoy working here, and likely neither will you.

## The Programming Gotcha

Here's how this interview-style works. You sit down at the table, the interviewer opens up their laptop, slides it over to you, and you see a few cryptic lines of code. This code never looks like code that would be approved in a pull request. Maybe it uses rarely-used features of a programming language, or some of the carefully avoided "features" of JavaScript. Either way, this is not code you might work with every day.

Now, the interview asks you what this code will output. You know it's a trick question, and that whatever it appears to output is not actually the case.

You take a guess, you're close, but when the interview runs the code, you see that some quirk of the language produces an unexpected result.

Why is this a red flag? Because it doesn't reflect how software engineers actually work. 

Think about a real, structural engineer. The design of the "code" (the blueprint) must be exactly right, because it's extremely expensive to hire the builders, get the building up, and realize that a crucial mistake is made. However, this is not true for software engineers. In modern languages like JavaScript and Go, building and running the program is extremely fast and cheap. You can do it many times per minute. 

It's perfectly acceptable, in fact I argue that it's expected, that an engineer will try many variations of their code—assisted by automated tests—to get the expected output.

It's also perfectly acceptable to never use certain features of a programming language. In fact, in JavaScript, we do this intentionally. If these features are difficult to use and error-prone, avoid them.

### How To Respond

How you respond depends on how urgently you need this job, or how badly you want to work for this company. It may be tempting to explain to the interviewer that their questions are bad, but that's unlikely to help anyone. If you're able to answer the questions correctly, you could get some extra points by carefully explaining why you think this questions can be troublesome, and by referring the interviewer to questions that you generally find to be more demonstrative of engineering skills.

Most of the time, you should just note that
