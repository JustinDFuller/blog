Too long; didn't read: I read [Getting Things Done (the art of stress-free productivity)](https://amzn.to/3qypQvF) and applied the principles with [Trello](trello.com).

I've never been this focused and productive in my life. Normally my thoughts are swirling around in my head so fast that I can barely keep up. I feel distracted, I have trouble deciding what I should be working on each moment, and transitioning between projects is difficult. 

Not any more though. Now I know exactly what I should be working on at all times. I can make this decision based on the priority of the work, combined with the energy and time that I have available.

Keep reading to find out how I made this change.
