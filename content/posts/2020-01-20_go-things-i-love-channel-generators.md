// This example shows the default, synchronous code 
// It takes 600ms to execute, which is far too slow 
// but the errors do allow you to stop short.

https://play.golang.org/p/UR6Plhj1CXI

// This example shows using a waitgroup to obtain concurrency
// it executes in half the time, 300ms, but, as will be shown in another
// example, there are some problems with the waitgroup error handling.

https://play.golang.org/p/fkr6mbeSehG

// This example shows the problems with the waitgroup errors
// They do not fail fast, it still takes 300ms even though an
// error happens after 200ms.

https://play.golang.org/p/TKq6O13StDP

// This example shows using a sync.ErrorGroup
// Unfortunately, it still waits for the whole WaitGroup
// to complete, because under the hood it uses a regular 
// wait group.
// And also, in my opinion, it still has many, subjectively,
// ugly anonymous functions.

https://play.golang.org/p/4ByVdSlxtWP

// This example shows using channel generators
// It stops after 200ms, but it has a manual cleanup
// with a for loop, select, and a manual counter
// This is very complex

https://play.golang.org/p/aHXBOpGLpHs

// This example shows methods that accept an error channel
// This is a bit less complex because there are less methods
// and less cleanup. Also less channels.
// Unfortunately, it's not very realistic that
// everything can happen concurrently.

https://play.golang.org/p/RZjAYOUXtgo

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.

https://play.golang.org/p/pKVDktQWCO0

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.
// Now channel-generators have been added to allow
// Some of the processes to run concurrently.
// Unfortunately, it doesn't fail fast on errors.

https://play.golang.org/p/3F-xnztMhxj

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.
// Now we are waiting for whichever channel returns first
// So on an error it will fail fast

https://play.golang.org/p/_LmnjayYw19

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.
// Now it has channel generators and no errors

https://play.golang.org/p/ZkAUyCUCyQx

Things I want to talk about:
* Go's first-class support of channels in select statements and for loops.
* Read and write-only channels
* Channel generators
* Ordering channel responses
  * Unordered responses: https://play.golang.org/p/p_3YPw9LrgC
  * Ordered responses: https://play.golang.org/p/EkYf-YSsErW
