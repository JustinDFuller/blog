One of my favorite reads is Joel Spoelsky's [Things You Should Never Do](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/). He wrote this post almost twenty years ago, outlining the downfall of Netscape and others because they spent years rewriting working code. His solution is, unsurprisingly, to refactor. About a year before Joel wrote _Things You Should Never Do_, Martin Fowler published his popular book, [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://amzn.to/2R6rFkP).

So, my question is, if we as a community figured out — twenty years ago — that we should stop rewriting programs, why is still commonly done today?
